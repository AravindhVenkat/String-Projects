# String-Projects

Since String is immutable, we use StringBuffer & StringBuilder to perform operations more flexibly.

MirrorImageByStringBuilder.java, a new object of StringBuffer is created, the entered String is copied to the variable of StringBuffer and built-in method of                                               StringBuffer Variable.reverse(); is used.

StringCharacterDemo.java file, Strings are converted to character array to perform methods

StringFunctions.java - contains basic string functions

StringModifyNumber.java - number in parameter is converted to String and it is then converted into Character Elements, number changing criteria applied, then
                          String Builder class is used to append strings, then it is converted back into a integer number
